Task 1 (Setup Project):
I learned how to organize a Java project properly using folders like src/ , adding a .gitignore file, and writing a basic README.md. Using Git helped me understand basic version control practices.

Task 2 (Basic Java Programming):

•  Task 3 (Strings and Arrays):
I improved my skills working with arrays, loops, and string manipulation, such as reversing strings, processing arrays, and conditional logic.

•  Task 4 (Object-Oriented Programming):
I learned how to use inheritance, method overriding, and access modifiers like protected Creating the Textbook subclass from Book helped me understand the importance of reusing code through inheritance.

•  Task 5 (Problem Solving with Loops and Conditions):
I practiced breaking down real-world problems into code using loops, conditions, and methods. Writing pattern generators and the shopping cart system helped me apply basic logic creatively.
